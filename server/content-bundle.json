					"description": "introduction",
					"content": "<h1>Introduction & Aim</h1><p>The Safe Delivery App is an aid for the skilled birth <br>attendant to manage the complications to women and babies during pregnancy, childbirth and the first weeks after birth.  Life threatening complications can happen to any pregnant women and her child, they often occur unexpected in “low risk pregnancies”.<br></p><p>Each year almost three million babies are born dead and as many die within the first month of life, while over a quarter of a million women die due to pregnancy and child birth totalling more than the number of deaths caused by the ‘three big diseases’ HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.</p><p> Assuring the quality of basic emergency obstetric and neonatal care (BEmONC) has proven to be of key importance to reduce death and disability of mothers and newborn.<br><br></p><h1>Videos</h1><p>The United Nations established 7 “signal functions” of BEmONC that every skilled birth attendant must be able to perform. These signal functions are all covered by the Safe Delivery App that has instruction videos on how to:</p><ol><li>Stop a post partum haemorrhage (PPH)</li><li>Remove a retained placenta</li><li>Manage maternal sepsis </li><li>Manage hypertensive disorders</li><li>Manage prolonged labour including how to perform vacuum extraction</li><li>Perform manual vacuum aspiration at   complications to abortion</li><li>Resuscitate a newborn</li></ol><p>Furthermore the Safe Delivery App has 2 videos on prevention of respectively;</p><ul><li>Active Management of the Third Stage of Labour (AMTSL)</li><li>Management of newborn complications</li><li>Infection prevention</li></ul><p>These instruction videos last around seven minutes. They are thought to be used as a self-teaching aid. They can be seen in full length or specific episodes can be chosen.</p><h1>Action Cards</h1><p>When you are in an emergency situation you may not have time to review the videos. Instead we have made “Action Cards” that have the essential recommendations for the management of the 7 BEmONC signal functions and early neonatal management.</p><h1>Essential Drugs</h1><p>The drug list contains useful information on the different drugs you should have available to perform BEmONC. The drugs are listed alphabetically with indications for use, dosage, when the drugs should not be used (contraindications) and common and rare adverse reactions to the drug.</p><p>Go through it to see if you have everything listed and make a purchase list of what you don’t have yet.</p><h1>Procedures</h1><p>Selected procedures are described in detail, for example how to insert a  nasogastric tube and how to clean a manual vacuum aspirator.</p><h1>Push Messages</h1><p>Once in a while you will receive messages guiding you to interesting parts of the Safe Delivery App for you to explore.<br><br>Push!</p><h1>Recent Updates!</h1><p>We recently (as of April 2017) made some changes to the Safe Delivery App we think may interest you:<br><br>1.\tWe updated the content based on the World Health Organization (WHO)’s new clinical guidelines.  <br><br>2.\tWe now structure our content according the clinical situation, for example Post Partum Haemorrhage, rather than by feature such as by video, allowing for more intuitive navigation in particular in emergency situations. <br><br>3.\tWe added in drug lists that are specific to each clinical situation, in addition to the existing comprehensive drug list.<br></p><h1>Learning Platform</h1><p>Soon the Safe Delivery App will include a new Learning Platform.</p><p>Here you will be able to test and strengthen your knowledge of BEmONC and the additional three related topics covered in the Safe Delivery App through quizzes.</p><p>You will be able to track your personal learning journey and gain your personal certification as a Safe Delivery Champion.</p><p>Each theme has 3 levels and each of these levels consist of 12 questions, which must be answered correctly in order to proceed to the next level.</p><p>There are three types of questions which may be answered in three different formats: <br>1) by choosing 1 correct answer when you see the symbol ◯<br>2) by choosing more correct answers when you see the symbol ☐ and <br>3) by arranging cards in the right order.</p><p>As a user you can create a profile and you have the possibility to create more than one user profile on the device. </p><p>A user profile can be created both online and offline on the device.</p><p>When creating an online user you will have the possibility to recover you password and thereby your progress on the learning platform if you change your phone or have to re-install the Safe Delivery App. </p><p>Be aware that deleting the app from your phone will cause your progress to be lost – unless you log out of the platform before doing so.</p><h1>The Safe Delivery Champion Certificate:</h1><p>The certification test will be available to you 14 days after you have passed all themes in the Safe Delivery App Learning Platform with 3 stars in each level.</p><p>The certification test is a comprehensive test of knowledge of performing the clinical procedures described in the Safe Delivery App. The certification test consists of 15 cases with 1-7 questions for each – a total of 53 questions.</p><p>Once you have completed and passed the test you will receive a certificate with your new status as a Safe Delivery Champion. </p><p>The certificate will last for a year, and you can receive a print-out version of the certificate by email. </p><hr><p><strong><span color='highlighted'>Thank you very much for downloading the Safe Delivery App.</strong></span></p><p><strong><span color='highlighted'>We are full of admiration for your work and the lives you safe!</strong></span></p><table >\n                    <tbody>\n                        <tr><th><div contentEditable='true' bold='true'>   </div></th><th><div contentEditable='true' bold='true'>Phototherapy</div></th><th><div contentEditable='true' bold='true'>Phototherapy</div></th></tr>\n                        <tr><td><div contentEditable='true'>Age</div></td><td><div contentEditable='true'>Healthy infant &ge;
