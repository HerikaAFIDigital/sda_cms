Project Description:

Maternity Foundation is a denmark-based NGO focusing on women's healthcare. It aims to upscale healthcare workers, particularly midwives, by providing aid tools. The organization has created a learning system enabling midwives to upskill themselves with the latest WHO guidelines. It is adaptable to localizing guidelines too. This app integrates national and regional medical guidelines. This ensures that the content remains relevant to specific healthcare contexts, making it more useful to user.
