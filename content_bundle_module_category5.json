          "content": "<h1>Preamble</h1><p>PEP is Post-Exposure Prophylaxis.</p><p>It means taking antiretroviral medicines (ART) after being potentially exposed to HIV to prevent becoming infected.</p><h1>Indications and Usage</h1><p>PEP should be considered if you’ve had a recent possible exposure to HIV at work.</p><p>Report your exposure to your supervisor, and seek medical attention immediately.</p><p>Occupational transmission of HIV to health care workers is extremely rare, and the proper use of safety devices and barriers can help minimize the risk of exposure while caring for patients with HIV.</p><h1>Dosage and Administration</h1><p>PEP must be started within 72 hours after a recent possible exposure to HIV, but the sooner you start the PEP, the better. </p><p>Every hour counts. </p><p>If you're prescribed PEP, you'll need to take it once or twice daily for 28 days.</p><p>PEP is effective in preventing HIV when administered correctly, but not 100%.</p><p>PEP normally consists of three anti-HIV drugs, from two of the different classes.</p><p>(A regimen for post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV with two ARV drugs is effective, but three drugs are preferred).</p><p>TDF + 3TC (or FTC) + EFV as a fixed-dose combination is recommended as the preferred option to initiate ART for adults and adolescents.</p><p>Remember to take an HIV test 3 months after exposure. </p><p>Pregnant and breastfeeding women can be treated with PEP.</p><h1>Contraindications</h1><p>Do not treat pregnant women with Efavirenz or Nevirapin.</p><h1>Adverse Reactions</h1><p>HIV treatment can cause side-effects which tend to be the worst when you first start taking them.</p><p>If you are taking PEP you may experience some unpleasant side-effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches and fatigue.</p><p>The drugs used in a course of PEP today are less likely to cause side-effects than those used in the past.</p>"

          "content": "<h1>Indications and Usage</h1><p>Calcium antagonist used to treat hypertension in pregnancy.   </p><p><strong>CAUTION:</strong> Diastolic blood pressure should not be lowered below 90 mmHg. </p><p>It is not uncommon that Nifedipine actually lowers the blood pressure below this point, and therefore should not be given as the drug of first choice.</p><p>(Alternatives could be Labetalol or Methyldopa for oral treatment and Hydralazine for IV treatment). </p><p>In case of severe preeclampsia delivery should be planned within 24 hours (48 hours if the woman's condition leaves time for lungmaturation of a fetus between GA 24 and 34).</p><p> Tocolysis:</p><p>Nifedipine can stop contractions at threatening preterm birth before 34 weeks of gestation to give time for lung maturation therapy (Dexamethasone or Betamethasone).</p><p>Tocolysis must not be given if chorioamnionitis is suspected.</p><h1>Dosage and Administration</h1><p>See <strong>CAUTION </strong>under \"indications and usage\".</p><p>In some settings, nifedipine is available in more than one formulation (e.g. immediate-release, intermediate-release and sustained-release). </p><p>Immediate-release nifedipine is included here, unless we indicate otherwise. </p><p>To avoid medication errors, it is important to specify and confirm the nifedipine formulation before administering it.</p><p><strong>Non-severe hypertension- </strong>Systolic BP: &gt;/= 150 mmHg or diastolic BP: &gt;/= 100 mmHg. </p><p>Administer 10–20 mg orally every 12 hours. </p><p>The maximum dose is 120 mg per 24 hours.</p><p><strong>Severe hypertension- </strong>Systolic BP: &gt;/= 160 mmHg or diastolic BP &gt;/= 110 mmHg: </p><p>Oral treatment:  </p><p>Administer 10 mg orally. </p><p>Repeat dose after 30 minutes if response is inadequate until optimal blood pressure is reached. </p><p>The maximum total dose is 30 mg in the acute treatment setting - Other treatment options should be considered if blood pressure is not lowered within the acute treatment phase of 90 minutes with 30 mg immediate-release. </p><p>The antihypertensive effect is fastest if given sublingually but the effect can be to strong and cause hypotension and compromised fetal circulation.</p><hr noshade><p><strong>Tocolysis: </strong></p><p>10 mg orally every 15 min until contractions stop for a maximum of four doses, then 20 mg oral every 6 hours. </p><p>Treatment should not exceed 24 hours.</p><p>Tocolysis is contraindicated if chorioamnionitis or abrupted placenta is suspected. Give a tocolytic drug (e.g. nifedipine) to provide a window for administration of antenatal corticosteroids and/or in-utero fetal transfer to an appropriate neonatal health care setting: Give a loading dose of 20 mg nifedipine immediate-release  sublingually. </p><p>If required, give an additional 10 mg every 15 minutes up to a maximum of 40 mg in the first hour. </p><p>Follow up with 20 mg sustained-release tablet (pay attention to the formulation) orally daily for up to 48 hours or until transfer is completed, whichever comes first.</p><p>Monitor maternal and fetal condition (pulse, blood pressure, signs of respiratory distress, uterine contractions, loss of amniotic fluid or blood, fetal heart rate, fluid balance). </p><p>Note: Do not give tocolytic drugs for more than 48 hours.</p><ul><li>Do not give a combination of tocolytic agents as there is no additional benefit. </li><li>Tocolytics should not be used in the following conditions: - preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) - chorioamnionitis - placental abruption - cardiac disease.</li></ul><h1>Contraindications</h1><p>Treatment with Rifampicin. Suspected fetal distress, suspected abruption of placenta, suspected chorioamnionitis. Tocolytics should not be used in the following conditions: - preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) - chorioamnionitis - placental abruption - cardiac disease. CAUTION: see above, should not be the first drug of choice to treat hypertension.</p><p> </p><h1>Adverse Reactions</h1><p>Common adverse reactions are constipation, vasodilatation, edema, headache, flushing, dizzyness, tiredness, and itching. </p><p>Uncommon adverse reactions are nausea, dryness of the mouth, heart palpitations, respiratory distress, nose bleeding, joint pain, anxiety, sleeping disturbances, frequent urge for and painful urination, visual disturbances and allergic reactions. </p><p>Rare adverse reactions are urticaria and other severe allergic reactions.</p>"
